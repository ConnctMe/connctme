# Overview
Welcome to ConnctMe, the iOS app to help you build faster, richer, and more lasting connections!

Networking is hard, especially with social distancing protocols in place. With ConnctMe, you can easily create your profile and make connections just by scanning a QR code. After connecting, you can also search through and filter your connections to make sure you can easily stay in touch.

ConnctMe is a project created for Hack@Home 2020. You can learn more at our [Devpost submission](https://devpost.com/software/connctme).

# Installation
Unfortunately, ConnctMe is not yet deployed on the App Store. If you're looking to test out our prototype, please be sure that you have XCode 12 and Cocoapods installed. You can install Cocoapods in Terminal by running
```sudo gem install cocoapods```

### Steps
1. After installing XCode and Cocoapods, clone this GitHub repository.
2. Open the root directory and run `pod install` to install the necessary pods.
3. Open the project in XCode and select your device. You can either run ConnctMe on the simulator or on an iOS device connected to your laptop.
4. Build the project (`⌘Cmd + B`) and run (`⌘Cmd + R`).
